      # Important: Point the Client's API calls to the same origin (relative path)
      # or explicitly set it if needed. Since we are serving from the same domain,
      # relative paths in Axios would work, or we default to the current URL.
      # But since the build process runs in the build environment, we need to ensure
      # the client knows where to look.
      # If VITE_API_URL is empty, we should ensure the client connects to /api
